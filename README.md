👋 Hi, I’m @ImResilience-dev
	•	👀 I’m interested in: Building AI-powered tools, automation projects, and enhancing productivity using technology.
	•	🌱 I’m currently learning: How to create a fully functional AI chatbot integrated with Telegram for managing tasks like CAPS-R tracking and providing AI-driven responses.
	•	💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: AI development, chatbot design, and practical automation solutions.
	•	📫 How to reach me: [Your contact info here].
	•	⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy combining technology with personal growth principles, inspired by the philosophy of Kaizen.

 Current Project: KaizenPMA Telegram AI Bot

I am building KaizenPMA, a Telegram chatbot that will:
	1.	Track and manage CAPS-R reports (Contacts, Appointments, Presentations, Sales, and Referrals).
	2.	Provide AI-driven responses using OpenAI’s GPT-4 API.
	3.	Motivate users with insights and goal-setting features.


Project Progress
1.	Setup:
	•	Installed Anaconda Spyder as the development environment.
	•	Created a Python virtual environment and installed required libraries:
	•	python-telegram-bot
	•	openai
	•	sqlite3
2.	Bot Creation:
	•	Created the bot using Telegram’s BotFather and obtained the API token:

3.	Development:
	•	Wrote Python scripts to:
	•	Start the bot (/start command).
	•	Accept CAPS-R data in a structured format (/input command).
	•	Summarize the data (/summary command).
	•	Respond to user queries with OpenAI GPT-4 (/ask command).
4.	Challenges:
	•	Researching how to host the bot for 24/7 availability (e.g., Replit, Heroku).
	•	Integrating AI seamlessly into the bot for real-time assistance.
	•	Securing API credentials for deployment.

 Next Steps

1.	Enhance Features:
	•	Improve CAPS-R input flexibility.
	•	Add more conversational abilities using OpenAI API.
2.	Deployment:
	•	Deploy the bot on a reliable platform like Replit or Heroku for continuous operation.
3.	Document Learning:
	•	Sharing progress and insights through GitHub updates.


 Goals
	•	Complete the AI integration to make the bot smarter and more responsive.
	•	Deploy the bot to operate continuously.
	•	Use the project to deepen my understanding of AI, Python development, and automation tools.
